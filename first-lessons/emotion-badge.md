# Emotion badge

## @showdialog

In this project, you will make an emotion badge on your micro:bit to share how you are feeling.

## 
You don't need ``||basic: on start||`` or ``||basic: forever||`` so let's drop them back into the toolbox (the middle section).

## 
Now find the ``||input: on button A pressed||`` block.  It's in the Input category in the toolbox.  

Drag it into your code window.

## 
Let's show a happy face when we press button A, so find the ``||basic: show icon||`` block (in the Basic category).

Put it inside the ``||input: on button A pressed||`` block and select the happy face icon.

## 
Let’s test your code in the micro:bit on-screen simulator.

Nothing will happen until you press button A on-screen.   Then the micro:bit will show a happy face. 

## 
Now, let's add code for pressing button B.

You can get a new ``||input: on button A pressed||`` block (from the Input category) and use the arrow next to A to change it to B.  

## 
Find the ``||basic: show icon||`` block (in the Basic category) and put it inside the ``||input: on button B pressed||`` block.

Then select the sad face icon.

## 
Let’s test your code in the micro:bit on-screen simulator again.

Remember you need to press button A or B on-screen. Do different faces appear for the different buttons?

## 
Now download your code onto your micro:bit.  Press the download button and follow the instructions.

When you press button A or B on your micro:bit, you should see a different face.
