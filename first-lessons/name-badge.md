# Name badge

## @showdialog

In this project, you will turn your micro:bit into a name badge.

## 

You don't need ``||basic: on start||`` so let's drop it back into the toolbox (the middle section) to tidy it away.  

## 

Now find the ``||basic: show string||`` block.  It's in the Basic category in the toolbox.  

Put this inside the ``||basic: forever||`` block. 

## 

Inside the ``||basic: show string||`` block, change the text ‘hello’ to your name.  

## 

Let’s test your code in the micro:bit on-screen simulator.

You should see your name scrolling on the micro:bit. 

## 

Now download your code onto your micro:bit.  Press the download button and follow the instructions.

You should see your name scrolling on your micro:bit.

Congratulations - you have made a micro:bit name badge!
